# Learning Design Patterns
This is a repository of code that I wrote from the examples in *Head First Design Patterns* by Eric Freeman, Elizabeth Freeman, Kathy Sierra, and Bert Bates.
I decded to go through this textbook after getting gilled in a job interview test.

I also decided to do the code in C# so that I can learn a new language at the same time.
